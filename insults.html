  <h2>&#9760; Insult Sword Fighting Guide &#9760;</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 11px; color: #888;">(for <i>The Secret of Monkey Island</i>)</p>

  <p>
    Insult Sword Fighting is one of the most memorable gameplay mechanics in <i>The Secret of Monkey
    Island</i>. Instead of relying on reflexes, sword fights are won with <b>wit</b>! You must learn
    insults from random pirates in the forest, then use the correct <b>comeback</b> to each insult.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b style="color:#ffaa33;">TIP:</b> Fight as many random pirates as you can before challenging the
    Sword Master. You need to learn insults by having them used against you, AND learn comebacks by
    using the right response. Once you know most of them, you're ready to take on
    <b style="color:#dd5500;">Carla, the Sword Master</b>!
  </p>

  <h3>Standard Insults &amp; Comebacks</h3>

  <h3>Sword Master Insults &amp; Comebacks</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 11px; color: #888;">
    <b>NOTE:</b> The Sword Master (Carla) uses DIFFERENT insults! But your regular comebacks still
    work against her &mdash; you just have to figure out which comeback goes with which new insult!

  <h3>Tips for Winning</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Fight LOTS of random pirates first! You learn new insults each time.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to which comebacks work &mdash; the pirate will stumble backward if you choose correctly.</li>
    <li>You need to win 3 out of 5 exchanges to win a fight.</li>
    <li>Don't challenge the Sword Master until you know at least 10-12 insult/comeback pairs.</li>
    <li>Remember: the Sword Master uses DIFFERENT insults, but the same comebacks work!</li>
    <li>If you lose to the Sword Master, just go fight more pirates and come back.</li>
  </ol>
