  <h2>&#9760; The Murray Shrine &#9760;</h2>

  <p>
    <b style="color:#dd5500;">Murray</b> is the greatest character ever to grace an adventure game. Once a fearsome
    skeleton pirate in LeChuck's undead army, he was reduced to a mere skull by a cannon blast from Guybrush
    Threepwood in the opening of <i>The Curse of Monkey Island</i>. But did that stop Murray? <b>NEVER!</b>
    Despite his lack of limbs... or a body... or anything below the jaw, really... Murray remains the
    self-proclaimed "all-powerful demonic skull" and the "harbinger of your doom."

  <div class="murray-quote">
    <span class="speaker">Murray:</span> I'm a powerful demonic force! I'm the harbinger of your doom! And the
    forces of darkness will applaud me as I STRIDE through the gates of hell carrying your head on a pike!<br><br>
    <span class="speaker speaker-guybrush">Guybrush:</span> Stride?<br><br>
    <span class="speaker">Murray:</span> All right then, ROLL! Roll through the gates of hell. Must you take
    the fun out of everything?
  </div>

  <div class="murray-quote">
    <span class="speaker speaker-guybrush">Guybrush:</span> How can you see without eyeballs?<br><br>
    <span class="speaker">Murray:</span> How can you walk around without a brain? Some things no one can explain.
  </div>

  <div class="murray-quote">
    <span class="speaker speaker-guybrush">Guybrush:</span> You're just a skull. You don't scare anybody.<br><br>
    <span class="speaker">Murray:</span> Oh yeah? Well, I'll... I'll bite your kneecaps off!<br><br>
    <span class="speaker speaker-guybrush">Guybrush:</span> Okay, that's a little scary.
  </div>

  <div class="murray-quote">
    <span class="speaker">Murray:</span> You may have won THIS round, Threepwood, but the forces of darkness
    will destroy you!<br><br>
    <span class="speaker speaker-guybrush">Guybrush:</span> And why's that?<br><br>
    <span class="speaker">Murray:</span> Because... um... they're powerful and... demonic and... stuff.
    Look, could you just cower in fear a little?<br><br>
    <span class="speaker speaker-guybrush">Guybrush:</span> No.

    <span class="speaker speaker-guybrush">Guybrush:</span> Murray, you don't have any arms or legs.<br><br>
    <span class="speaker">Murray:</span> That's... besides the point.
  </div>

  <div class="murray-quote">
    <span class="speaker">Murray:</span> Bwahahahaha! Do my demonic powers FRIGHTEN you?<br><br>
    <span class="speaker speaker-guybrush">Guybrush:</span> Not really, no.<br><br>
